# About
This simle webapp tracks how many times your GitHub Release has been downloaded. I have a few private Homebrew apps that use GitHub Releases for distribution and I needed a decent way to track how many times each release ( using tag_names ) has been downloaded.  So I created this little webapp to give me the stats for any GitHub Release package.

# Note

# Technology Used
The frontend is written in ReactJs. The backend is uses AWS Lambda written in Rust Language for it's API calls.
